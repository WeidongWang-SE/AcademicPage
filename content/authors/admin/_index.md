      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Weidong WANG received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2016. From Jan 2013 to Jan 2015, he was a visiting scholar in the department of computer  science, University of Wyoming. During that time, from Jun 2014 to Aug 2014, he was a visiting  scholar in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL. Currently, he is a lecturer at the  Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology. His research interests mainly  include hardware/software performance optimization in large-scale parallel environments. For  the aspect of design, he focuses on using software and hardware co-design and Software Engineering (SE) methods such as component service composition and QoS evaluation to  improve the performance of systems. For the aspect of implementation, he works on optimizing software and hardware performance, enhancing resilience and improving service-oriented architecture.
