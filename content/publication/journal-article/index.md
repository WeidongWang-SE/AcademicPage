abstract: In the field of software engineering, large and complex code bases may lead to some burden of understanding their structure and meaning for developers. To reduce the burden on developers, we consider a code base visualization method to visually express the meaning of code bases. Inspired by remote sensing imagery, we employ graphical representations to illustrate the semantic connections within Java code bases, aiming to help developers understand its meaning and logic. This approach is segmented into three distinct levels of analysis. First, at the project-level, we visualize Java projects by portraying each file as an element within a code forest, offering a broad overview of the project’s structure. This macro-view perspective aids in swiftly grasping the project’s layout and hierarchy. Second, at the file-level, we concentrate on individual files, using visualization techniques to highlight their unique attributes and complexities. This perspective enables a deeper understanding of each file’s structure and its role within the larger project. Finally, at the component-level, our focus shifts to the detailed analysis of Java methods and classes. We examine these components for complexity and other specific characteristics, providing insights that are crucial for the optimization of code and the enhancement of software quality. By integrating remote sensing technology, our method offers software engineers deeper insights into code quality, significantly enhancing the software development lifecycle and its outcomes.
